All documentation assumes you have a basic understanding of how to use your 
computer and the programs you have purchased for it.

BASIC REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
Stock Footage files work with today's most popular editing and presentation 
programs including AVID, Adobe Premiere, Media 100, Media Studio Pro 5.0, 
Radius, VideoWave, PowerPoint and more. Any other hardware requirements will be 
based primarily on the applications you use and the type of final output you 
plan to produce. 

INSTALLATION
-------------

You must have QuickTime 3 installed into your system. We have provided a current 
version on this CD-ROM. To install QuickTime 3 from this CD-ROM, simply enter 
the QT301 directory and run SETUP.EXE. Follow the on-screen instructions to 
install the QuickTime 3 software, then restart your computer.

You must have QuickTime 3 installed into your system. Check to see if you have a 
copy of QuickTime 3 installed on your computer. If you are unsure, the QuickTime 
3 extension can be found in the Extensions folder located inside the System 
Folder of your Macintosh hard drive. If QuickTime 3 is not installed (or you are 
still unsure), we have provided a current version on this CD-ROM. To install 
QuickTime 3 from this CD-ROM, double-click the QuickTime 3 Installer Folder 
inside the application. After installation is finished, restart your Macintosh 
to activate QuickTime 3.

Tips for using 
------------
Avid Technology

Choose file>Import> A dialog box will appear in which one can specify various 
options such as "quicktime" & "maintain aspect ratio" or "fit to screen".  We 
recomend you choose quicktime and mantain aspect ratio. After you choose files 
select "done" .  The file or files chosen may take a few minutes to import. Once 
imported they will appear in the active source bin window.

Media 100
Choose file>Import> A dialog box will appear which you can specify various 
parameters. Media 100 uses 720X486 pixcels and 640x480 pixcels depending on the 
model.  For 640x480 one will have to resize to that aspect ratio when importing 
files.

For other applications and hardware please refer to the owners manuals for 
further information on the use of digital quicktime movie clips.
