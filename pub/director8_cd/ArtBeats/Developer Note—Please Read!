A Note to the Developer...The clips on this CD are in two formats: NTSC & PAL. If you wish to use only one of the two formats, simply rename the “NTSC” or “PAL” folder as “Artbeats” and copy it to your master. If you wish to use both formats, please create a folder called “Artbeats” and put both the “NTSC” and “PAL” folders in it.The ISO-9660 partition of this hybrid CD-ROM contains executable programs for Windows users in the “Useful Software” folder in both  the PAL and the NTSC folders, ready for those folders to be directly copied to a CD master. If you plan to use both PAL and NTSC content on your CD, you may wish to remove one of these folders so that you only have one copy on your final CD. This software is in a different location on the Macintosh partition of this CD!If you are creating a Windows or hybrid CD on a Macintosh, you should include the contents of the “for Windows CDs only” folder that is on the Mac partition of this CD, or use the “NTSC” and “PAL” folders that are on the Windows partition of this CD. Please do not include the “for Windows CDs only” folder on a Macintosh partition! The Mac partition and the Windows partition will be slightly different.The movies are cross-platform QuickTime and the Read Me files are all html, so you can create a hybrid CD with no further changes. If you have any difficulties reading both partitions or need any assistance for any reason, please contact Bob Hayes at bob@artbeats.com or (541) 863-4429.
