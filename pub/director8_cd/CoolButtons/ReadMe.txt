You can use these buttons and the "MultiPurpose Button" behavior royalty free.The button graphics in this Cast Library are all 32bit Fireworks PNG graphics with alpha channels. Many of the buttons contain transparent beveling effects and drop shadows and will display nicely over any background. The original Graphic "Factories" used to create these buttons are provided in both Fireworks PNG and PhotoShop PSD formats. Feel free to modify them however you like. There is also a folder called "Buttons" that you can drag into your LIBS folder (found in the Director 8 application folder) that will install them into the Library Palette. This Cast Library also includes eight sounds that will work well with your buttons.Almost no animals were harmed during the creation of these buttons. At one point Rob accidentally rolled his chair over his dog's tail, but no permanent damage was done.Enjoy!Rob & JohnCopyright 2000, Robert C. Martin and John R. Nyquist.
