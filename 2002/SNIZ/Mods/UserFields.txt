<b>Instructions.</b>

Unzip...
	admin_user_fields.asp, pop_ufield_table.asp, and pop_ufield_record.asp

to your forum directory

Copy the code in inc_functions_extra.asp to the end of the inc_functions.asp file

If you have NOT modified

	admin_config_members.asp
	pop_profile.asp

then unzip them to your forum directory. If you have already made changes to these files,
you will find all the required changes are clearly commented.

Finally unzip the member_profile_setup.asp to your forum directory and execute it in your 
browser. (this will make the required DB changes)


That's all folks...
